# Development Notes

This project follows advanced Laravel development practices with a clean and scalable architecture.

Since this is a product-based project, the codebase includes advanced implementations and design patterns. I can explain any module or code section line by line, as I have completed the official Laracasts Laravel series and have applied those best practices throughout the project.
